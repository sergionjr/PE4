Programming Exercise 4 - TicTacToe
Team Members: Sergio Nogueira

Note: I was very sick for this activity so I did it all on my own while still going through the merge and pull requests.

This program plays tic tac toe. To run it, you must compile the .cpp file into an executable, and run the executable accordingly. It allows for 2 players for up to 9 rounds, selecting a row and then a column to place your dedicated player marker. I ran this on a linux terminal, using g++ to compile the file and ./TicTacToe to execute it.
